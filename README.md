# Summary
This tutorial presents the basic Bayesian approach to linear regression as developed in Bishop's [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474997498&sr=8-1&keywords=pattern+recognition+and+machine+learning) text.  It follows his same approach and example, but provides the code in a jupyter notebook environment and my own explanations of the material.

The tutorial leverages a conjugate prior which leads to simple update equations for the posterior parameter distribution.  This is well suited for an environment of streaming data and online learning.
